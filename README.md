## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JohnY0920/labubu_pilot.git
   cd labubu_pilot
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file in the project directory
   echo "DISCORD_WEBHOOK=your_discord_webhook_url_here" > .env
   echo "POPMART_USERNAME=your_email@example.com" >> .env
   echo "POPMART_PASSWORD=your_password" >> .env
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Discord Integration (Optional)
DISCORD_WEBHOOK=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your_webhook_url

# Pop Mart Credentials (Optional - will prompt if not provided)
POPMART_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
POPMART_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

### Product URLs

The bot is pre-configured to monitor specific Labubu product ranges. To customize the target products, edit the `PRODUCTS` list in `labubu_bot.py`:

```python
# Current configuration monitors products with IDs from 50000-50990
PRODUCTS = [f"https://www.popmart.com/ca/pop-now/set/293-1000{str(i).zfill(4)}00879" for i in range(5000, 5100, 10)]
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Method 1: Direct Python Execution
```bash
python labubu_bot.py
```

### Method 2: Shell Script (macOS/Linux)
```bash
chmod +x run_bot.sh
./run_bot.sh
```

### Bot Workflow

1. **Initialization**: The bot starts up and configures Chrome WebDriver
2. **Authentication**: Logs into Pop Mart using provided credentials
3. **Monitoring**: Continuously scans configured product URLs
4. **Detection**: When a product becomes available, the bot will:
   - ‚úÖ Play an audio alert
   - üì± Send Discord notification (if configured)
   - üåê Keep the browser window open on the product page
   - üìù Display purchase instructions

5. **Manual Completion**: User completes the purchase manually for security

## üìä Output & Logging

- **Console Output**: Real-time status updates and progress information
- **Log File**: Detailed logs written to `labubu_pilot.log`
- **Discord Alerts**: Instant notifications when products are found
- **Audio Alerts**: System sound notifications for immediate attention

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Detection Features

The bot implements several sophisticated measures to maintain stealth:

- **Dynamic User Agents**: Rotates between modern browser identities
- **Human-like Timing**: Random delays between actions (0.5-1.5 seconds)
- **WebDriver Masking**: Removes automation detection signatures
- **Natural Browsing**: Mimics real user interaction patterns
- **Profile Management**: Uses clean browser profiles
- **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from detection attempts

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Delays
Modify `human_like_delay()` function to adjust timing:
```python
def human_like_delay():
    time.sleep(random.uniform(0.5, 1.5))  # Adjust range as needed
```

### User Agent Rotation
Add custom user agents to the `USER_AGENTS` list for variety.

### Monitoring Frequency
The bot checks products continuously with built-in delays for optimal performance.

## üö® Important Notes

- **Manual Purchase**: For security, the bot assists with detection but requires manual purchase completion
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays prevent overwhelming Pop Mart's servers
- **Credential Security**: Use environment variables to protect login information
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure usage complies with Pop Mart's Terms of Service
- **Browser Updates**: Keep Chrome browser updated for optimal compatibility

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Chrome Driver Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Update Chrome to latest version
   # Ensure ChromeDriver is in PATH
   ```

2. **Login Problems**:
   - Verify credentials in `.env` file
   - Check for two-factor authentication requirements
   - Ensure Pop Mart account is active

3. **Detection Issues**:
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Try different user agents
   - Increase delay intervals

### Getting Help

- Check `labubu_pilot.log` for detailed error information
- Ensure all prerequisites are properly installed
- Verify network connectivity and firewall settings
